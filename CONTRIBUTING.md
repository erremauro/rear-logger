# How to contribute

Contribution of any nature are always welcome, just follow the code convention 
you see across the project and make sure to _lint_ your code.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/rearjs/rear-logger.git

Setup your environment:

    yarn install

Make sure all tests passes:

    yarn test

## Making Changes

Start by creating a new branch for the change you want to make. For example:

    git branch `fix-logger-error-arguments`
    git checkout `fix-logger-error-arguments`

Now you can apply and commit your changes, just remember to always write tests
for the the changes you make.

You can run `yarn start` while you code to watch for source changes that will 
automatically lint your code and create a new build, ready to be tested. How
cool is that?

Once you completed your modifications, go open a pull request!
